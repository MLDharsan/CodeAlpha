# 🎮 Hangman Game

A simple text-based Hangman game built with Python as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship.

## 📋 Description

This is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game features a clean console interface with visual progress tracking.

## ✨ Features

- 🎲 Random word selection from predefined list
- ❤️ Visual progress bar showing remaining attempts
- ✅ Input validation (single letters only)
- 🔄 Play again option
- 🎨 Color-coded status messages
- 📊 Real-time game status updates

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **random module** - For random word selection
- **Built-in data structures** - Sets, lists, strings

## 🎯 Key Concepts Implemented

- Loops (while, for)
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Functions and modular code
- String manipulation
- Sets for efficient letter tracking
- Input validation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MLDharsan/CodeAlpha.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game
```
4. Run the game:
```bash
   python hangman_game.py
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game will select a random word
2. Guess one letter at a time
3. You have 6 incorrect guesses allowed
4. Guess all letters correctly to win!
5. If you run out of attempts, you lose
